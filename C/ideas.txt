expression is a array[32] of tokens if an expression in code is more than 32 tokens
long then we simply add to "expressions" together

definition is a array[32] array of tokens that are not an expression

line is an array[32] of "expressions" and "definitions"
a line in code can't be longer than 32 "expressions" or "definitions"
(at this time)
