# What is Master Script
master script(ms) is simeler to c++
it ames to be a little more user friendly with the same amount of control
some examples are variables, in c you have to specify a type. int, float, char, etc
in ms you can simply use the 'var' key word. if you wont to use the variable as a int
you can but if you then wont to use it as a string thats fine to.  if you asine variable a int value
and treat it as a string it will simply get the ascy char of the int you asined to it.
